# marta info

	This is a simple application written in JavaScript. There is an Express.js backend server with a PostgreSQL database containing user login credentials. The server handles login and acts as a middleman between the React.js frontend and the MARTA APIs to fetch real time bus and rail information.

	The stylesheets are handled by bootstrap. State management is done with Redux and React-Redux. There is a Redux-Thunk package that handles asychronous fetch requests to the backend and updating the store with data.

	This project was done as my capstone for the Digital Crafts Full Stack Flex coding bootcamp.

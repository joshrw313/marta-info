# marta info

<p>	This is a simple application written in JavaScript. There is an Express.js backend server with a PostgreSQL database containing user login credentials. The server handles login and acts as a middleman between the React.js frontend and the MARTA APIs to fetch real time bus and rail information.
</p>
<p>
	The stylesheets are handled by bootstrap. State management is done with Redux and React-Redux. There is a Redux-Thunk package that handles asychronous fetch requests to the backend and updating the store with data.
</p>

	This project was done as my capstone for the Digital Crafts Full Stack Flex coding bootcamp.
